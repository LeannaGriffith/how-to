  <ol>
    <li>Take a deep breath of air and dive down as deep as possible.</li>
    <li>Position yourself parallel to the surface, tilting your head back slightly. You need to do this in order to create perfectly circular bubbles.</li>
    <li>Fill your cheeks with air and stick your tongue out a bit.</li>
    <li>Pull your tongue in quickly and release a burst of air by quickly popping your mouth open but maintaining the perfect circular shape.</li>
    <li>Now ask your friend to take some dope pictures of you and there you have your <i>Instagram</i> worthy pics!</li>
